# AI Sales Insights Assistant

An AI-powered web application that analyzes sales data and generates business insights through natural language queries. Users can upload raw sales data, visualize performance trends, and receive automated explanations and recommendations using a Large Language Model (LLM).


## Features

* Upload and analyze sales datasets (CSV format)
* Dynamic column selection to support different dataset structures
* Automatic data cleaning and preprocessing
* Key business metrics calculation:

  * Total Revenue
  * Number of Orders
  * Average Order Value
* Time-series visualizations to identify trends and sales patterns
* AI-powered insights that explain business performance in plain English
* Input validation and error handling for real-world usability


## How It Works

1. The user uploads a sales dataset.
2. The system allows selection of relevant columns such as price and date.
3. Data is cleaned and converted into appropriate formats.
4. Sales metrics and visual trends are generated.
5. A Large Language Model analyzes summarized data and answers user questions about business performance(whether sales increased or decreased).
